### SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)
Type: Hash function
Purpose: Integrity
Operation: SHA-256 takes an input (or "message") and returns a fixed-size 256-bit hash value. This process is deterministic and always produces the same hash for the same input.
Use Cases:
Data integrity verification: Ensuring that data has not been altered.
Digital signatures (in combination with RSA or other algorithms): Hash the data, then sign the hash.
Password hashing: Securely storing passwords.
Blockchain: Used extensively in blockchain technology to ensure data integrity.
Security: SHA-256 is currently considered secure. It is resistant to pre-image attacks, second pre-image attacks, and collision attacks, although theoretical vulnerabilities may exist as with any cryptographic algorithm.

### RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
Type: Asymmetric encryption algorithm
Purpose: Confidentiality, Authentication, Digital Signatures
Operation: RSA uses a pair of keys (public and private). Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key and vice versa.
Encryption/Decryption: Securely transmitting data by encrypting it with the recipient's public key.
Digital Signatures: Signing data with the sender's private key; the signature can be verified by anyone with the sender's public key.
Use Cases:
Secure communications: Encrypting data to ensure confidentiality during transmission.
Digital signatures: Ensuring authenticity and non-repudiation of messages.
Key exchange: Securely exchanging symmetric keys for use in faster encryption algorithms like AES.
Security: RSA's security is based on the difficulty of factoring large integers. As of now, it is considered secure when using sufficiently large key sizes (2048 bits or more).

### SHA256 vs RSA
Purpose:
SHA-256: Primarily used for data integrity verification.
RSA: Used for secure data transmission and digital signatures.
Functionality:
SHA-256: Generates a fixed-length hash value from input data.
RSA: Encrypts/decrypts data and creates/verifies digital signatures using key pairs.
Speed:
SHA-256: Generally faster as it only involves hashing operations.
RSA: Slower due to complex mathematical operations, typically used for small data sizes or encrypting keys.
Security:
SHA-256: Considered secure against current cryptographic attacks, with a focus on ensuring data integrity.
RSA: Security depends on key size; considered secure with adequately large keys but slower and more computationally intensive.
